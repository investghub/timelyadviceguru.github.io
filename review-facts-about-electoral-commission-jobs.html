<p>My cousin has been working with the Electoral Commission for about six years now and I can testify that they pay on time. 
    I want to consider applying for work with them but I am concerned about the stressful nature of the work. Any advice for me, Guru.</p>

        <p>Hi Ampa, I have been there before as a Data Entry Clerk and then moved higher to a District Technician. 
            So I have quite an experience with EC work. What I would advice is that you need to manage stress by getting 
            enough rest after an engaging activity. In so doing the body can reset for a new encounter/activity and not 
            breakdown. The pay is good for a short period of work so please jump on it. Cheers.</p>

        <p>Hi Jo, Unfortunately you can't. You will need at least an HND or Diploma. These positions include Registration Assistants 
            (Data Entry Clerks and Lamination Assistants), Exhibition Assistants and Polling Assistants 
            (Verification Officers, Ballot Issuers, and Name Reference List Officers). Cheers.</p>
