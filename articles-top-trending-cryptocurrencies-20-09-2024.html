            <h1 style="font-size: 35px; font-weight: bolder;">What is meant by a trending cryptocurrency?</h1>
            <p>A cryptocurrency trends when it gains widespread attention and adoption due to factors like innovative technology, strong community support, or solving real-world problems. Market sentiment, driven by news, endorsements, 
                or major partnerships, can create a surge in demand. Additionally, limited supply, 
                unique features, or use cases that differentiate it from other cryptocurrencies can attract investors and users, further driving its popularity. As more people become aware of its potential, the cryptocurrency's value and 
                visibility increase, leading to a trending status.</p>
