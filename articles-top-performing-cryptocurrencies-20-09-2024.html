        <p>Hi folks, I bring to you cryptocurrencies that are trending now. These cryptocurrencies have the highest 24-hour gains in the crypto market now. </p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 35px; font-weight: bolder;">What is 24-hour Change?</h2>
            <p>24-hour change is calculated by taking the current price of a cryptocurrency in a chosen base currency and comparing it with the price that this cryptocurrency was registering 24 hours ago.</p>
            
            <h2 style="font-size: 35px; font-weight: bolder;">What is meant by a performing cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>A cryptocurrency can be classified as a top performer for the day due to several factors, such as positive market sentiment, major announcements, or technical breakthroughs that boost investor confidence. For example, 
                news of a strategic partnership, technological upgrade, or listing on a major exchange can create a surge in buying interest. Additionally, high trading volumes driven by strong community support or a positive shift in 
                broader market trends can propel the cryptocurrencyâ€™s value upwards. Short-term factors like a successful token burn, reduced supply, or influential endorsements can also drive the cryptocurrency to outperform others on a given day.</p>
