        <p>So now you are at a cross-road as to how you can add an extra income to sustain you or you just need a job to keep you going whilst you search for a permanent job. I bring to you a list of part-time jobs to help you solve your finance issues. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Part-time jobs involve an engagement to work on a temporary basis, such as a data entry clerk or field worker, which are inherently flexible ways to make extra money.</b> In today's Ghana, these part-time jobs are very sought for due to economic hardship and I know you are reading this post because you searched for it. <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, find below the best part-time jobs in Ghana that offer so much flexibility in making money.</p><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 style="font-size: 35px; font-weight: bolder;">What is Part-Time Job?</h2>
            <p>A part-time job is a type of employment based on work that is considered flexible or temporary. Part-time workers typically work for short periods of time in a flexible mode of operation.

                <b>It is very important to know and understand that part-time workers are sometimes considered independent workers.</b> That means you are sometimes responsible for expenses related to your work such as taxes, health insurance and other benefits that come with traditional jobs. <br>
                <br>
                My advice to you is that to really make it with part-time jobs, <b>one best way is to stack jobs, which is the tried-and-tested idea of working multiple jobs at once.</b> When you do this, you are opening up more income streams never will never get in a tight spot if one job ends (short periods) or becomes less feasible (pay not worth it anymore). Take this instance, you can work with the Electoral Commission during stipulated periods and then be writing articles for newspapers at your free time.<br>
                <br>
                Due to the flexibility part-time jobs offer, you can do two or even three jobs at the same time to increase your income. This compared to traditional jobs where you have to keep set hours is a no-brainer.</p>

        <p>Getting engaged in a private school is one of the best paid part time jobs in the country at the moment. Private schools include basic, second cycle, and tertiary institutions that are owned by individuals. <br>
        <br>
        There are lots of private schools springing up of late for these two reasons amongst others. Firstly, the increase in population has created the need for more schools to be opened to absorb all those who cannot get admission into the public schools. Secondly, the seemingly <b>lack of quality education has resulted in most parents rather preferring private schools despite the huge amount of fees charged by these institutions.</b><br>
        <br>
        The increase in numbers and subsequent increase in student population in these schools means that the services of tutors are readily needed. <b>It is worthy to note that, due to operational costs and legal requirements, almost all these schools prefer engaging tutors on part time basis.</b><br>
        </p>

        In Ghana, Uber is <b>one of the most reliable ways of making money on a part-time basis.</b> It also offers so much flexibilty in terms of how and when you want to work since it sets a clear indication of how much money you can make i.e. <b>the more you work the more make money.</b><br>
        <br>
        And the best part of it is that it is so simple to register and work with Uber. You only need to download the Uber Driver App, register an account and voila you are set to go.<br>

<p>My cousin has been working with the Electoral Commission for about six years now and I can testify that they pay on time. 
    I want to consider applying for work with them but I am concerned about the stressful nature of the work. Any advice for me, Guru.</p>

        <p>Hi Ampa, I have been there before as a Data Entry Clerk and then moved higher to a District Technician. 
            So I have quite an experience with EC work. What I would advice is that you need to manage stress by 
            getting enough rest after an engaging activity. In so doing the body can reset for a new encounter/activity 
            and not breakdown. The pay is good for a short period of work so please jump on it. Cheers.</p>

        <p>Hi Jo, Unfortunately you can't. You will need at least an HND or Diploma. These positions include 
            Registration Assistants (Data Entry Clerks and Lamination Assistants), Exhibition Assistants 
            and Polling Assistants (Verification Officers, Ballot Issuers, and Name Reference List Officers). Cheers.</p>
